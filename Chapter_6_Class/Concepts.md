## Objects and Classes

**CONCEPT:-** An object is a software component that exists in memory and
serves a specific purpose in a program. An object is created from a Class
that contains code describing the object.

> - An object can store data. The data stored in an object are commonly called fields.
> - An object can perform operations. The operations that an object perform are called methods.

Objects are very important in Java. Here are some examples of objects that you have previously learned about:

- if you need to read input from the keyboard, or from a file, you can use a scanner object.
- if you need to generate random numbers, you can use a random object.
- if you need to write output to a file, you can use a PrintWriter object.

**A CLASS IS NOT AN OBJECT, BUT A DESCRIPTION OF AN OBJECT**

When a program is running, it can use the class to create, in memory, as many objects of a specific type as needed. Each object that is created from a class is called an instance of the class.
